# Carbolator

## Description of the project
Carbolator stands for carbon calculator, which says a lot about Carbolator's purpose. In the app, you can calculate the amount of carbon emissions your traveling activities generate, and compare different traveling options. The app uses data from the Distance Matrix API (Google Maps Platform) to get the distances for the trips, whereon we have used static data to calculate the carbon emissions for each type of travel option. To improve the user experience Google Maps Autocomplete is used when the user enters which cities or addresses to travel between.
