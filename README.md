# How to setup
1. Download the recommended version of node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Clone the repository to some folder. 
3. Cd this folder and run 'npm install' from the command line. This will install all React dependence. You might have to use --force or similar for some React libraries.
4. We also have our Firebase and Google API keys locally in the file .env.local. We do not want them publicly displayed on Github so we added the file in our Canvas submission. But this file needs to be moved to the root directory for Firebase and Google API to work!
5. Then just run 'npm start' from the terminal and the app should run :)
